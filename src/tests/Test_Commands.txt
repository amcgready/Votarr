You can run all tests using Vitest commands. Here are the different ways to run the tests:

1. Run all tests:
```bash
npm test
```
or
```bash
yarn test
```

2. Run tests with UI interface:
```bash
npm run test:ui
```
or
```bash
yarn test:ui
```

3. Run tests with coverage report:
```bash
npm run test:coverage
```
or
```bash
yarn test:coverage
```

4. Run tests in watch mode (automatically reruns when files change):
```bash
npm run test:watch
```
or
```bash
yarn test:watch
```

The coverage report will show:
- Lines of code covered
- Functions tested
- Branches covered
- Statements covered

This will help identify any gaps in testing.

Would you like me to show you how to interpret the test results or how to debug any failing tests?
